    <h1>The Best Movies According to phoT0N</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>"Interstellar" pushes the limits for personal interpretation of both science and fiction. Both elements are wildly heightened to a bold scale to address the internal opposites between logic and spectacle, science and sentiment, and brains and emotion.</p>
    <h3>Inception</h3>
    <p>“Inception” is a triumph, a perfectly oiled dream machine that can blow minds on first viewing and satisfy cinephiles on repeat viewings.</p>
    <h3>F1</h3>
    <p>Easily the best sports film of the year and firmly establishes Joseph Kosinski is one of the most consistent and skilled filmmakers of his generation.</p>
