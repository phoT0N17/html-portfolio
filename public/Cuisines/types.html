            <a href="./typesof/Asian.html"><h2>Asian Cuisine</h2></a>
            <p>Asian cuisine refers to the variety of cooking styles, ingredients, and food traditions found across the continent of Asia — the largest and most culturally diverse region on Earth.</p>
            <p>Because Asia is so vast, its cuisines differ greatly from region to region — from the spicy curries of India to the light and balanced meals of Japan.</p>

            <a href="./typesof/Euro.html"><h2>European Cuisine</h2></a>
            <p>European cuisine refers to the traditional foods, ingredients, and cooking styles that originated in Europe.</p>
            <p>It includes both simple rustic meals (like bread, cheese, and soups) and elegant fine dining (like French pastries or Italian pasta).</p>
            <p>European food has also shaped Western cooking worldwide — influencing restaurants, bakeries, and kitchens across the globe.</p>

            <p>It’s a mix of Native American roots, immigrant influences, and regional creativity — making it one of the most varied cuisines anywhere on Earth.</p>

            <a href="./typesof/meac.html"><h2>Middle Eastern & African Cuisine</h2></a>
            <p>Middle Eastern cuisine includes foods from countries like Lebanon, Turkey, Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Syria.</p>
            <p>It’s known for its fragrant spices, grilled meats, fresh herbs, and shared dishes.</p>
            <p>Meals are often served family-style — with mezze (small plates), bread, and dips.</p>
